Welcome to the Python Data Structures Tutorial. In this turorial, We will be looking three of the common data stuctures in python.

* [Set](1-sets.md)
* [Queue](2-queue.md)

In each module, there will be descriptions and examples. At the end of each topic, there will be a problem to solve. You should only look at the solution after you have made an attempt to solve the problem on your own.
